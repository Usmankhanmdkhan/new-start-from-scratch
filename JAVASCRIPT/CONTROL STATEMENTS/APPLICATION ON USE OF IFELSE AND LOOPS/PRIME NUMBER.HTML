      //HOW IT WORKS IT FIRST TAKE I=1;
      //I<=NUM THIS MEANS NUMBER WE ARE ENTERING IN INPUT BOX WILL GO FOR CONDITION OF LOOP
      //WE TOOK COUNT HERE AS WE KNOW IF A NUMBER IS PRIME IT WILL ONLY BE PURELY DIVIDED BY 1 AND BY ITS OWN
      //SO COUNT HAS TO BE 2 IF IT IS A PRIME NUMBER IF COUNT NUMBER INCREASES MORE THAN 2 THEN
      //IT IS NOT A PRIME NUMBER

      //SO AT START COUNT WAS 0 THEN  WE STARTED A LOOP IN WHICH THE NUMBER WE ARE GOING TO DIVIDE
      //THE NUMBER FROM 1 TO THE LAST NUMBER WHICH WOULD BE ITSELF ONLY
      //FOR EXAMPLE IF WE DEVIDE 29 FROM 1 TO 29 WE WILL SEE ONLY 1 AND 29 WILL GET REMINDER 0
      //AFTER DIVIDING FROM EACH NUMBER AND WE WILL GET COUNT 2 AS IT IS A PRIME NUMBER
